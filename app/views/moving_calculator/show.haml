%h2 The System
%p Moving help is a new system which utilizes customer-rented moving vehicles in order to minimize the price of a move.  Moving helpers are trained specialists who show up at your home to help you on your moving day.  There is a different equation for our helpers, because we have studied the factors which influence how long a move will take.

%p Here is the equation that we work with:
%p (2 men loading within 50 ft. of back door, no stairs)
%table{ :style => 'width: 100%;' }
  %tr
    %th Vehicle Size:
    %td 10 ft.
    %td 14 ft.
    %td 17 ft.
    %td 24 ft.
    %td 26 ft.
  %tr
    %th Loading Time:
    %td 30 mins.
    %td 1 hr.
    %td 1.5 hrs.
    %td 4 hrs.
    %td 4.5 hrs.
%ul
  %li Add 20% of time for each floor above the first.
  %li Add 20% of time for each 50 ft. of distance from door to ramp.
  %li Add 30% of time for an elevator; do not add time per floor.
  %li Add 5 minutes per piece of disassembly.
  %li Add 30 seconds per non-boxed item, open box, or poorly packaged item.
  %li Divide by the percent of space not filled in the truck.
  %li Subtract 30% of the total per extra man.
%p Example: A 14 ft. truck, third floor, 75 ft. from door, 2 beds to take down, half full.
%p To load: ( 1 hr. + 12 mins. + 12 mins. + 10 mins. ) / 2 = 47 mins.
%p To unload use the same equation again and multiply by 3/4.
%p This math is 90% effective.  The largest factor which affects time in an unpredictable way is the quality of the boxes.  Moving boxes are different than other boxes.  It's just plain quicker to handle good boxes vs. not-so-good boxes.
